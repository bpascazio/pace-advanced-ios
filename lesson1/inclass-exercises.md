# In Class Basic Swift

1. Create MyFirstClass
2. Add instanceVariable of type Int
3. Add instanceFunction which compares two integers and returns a boolean if the first is greater than or equal to the second.
4. Create a class func called TimeRemaining that returns a Double
5. Create a function called sendMessage that takes String parameters and prints out a concatenation
6. Create a function called poke which takes a name, message, and priority boolean and only calls sendMessage if priority is set to True
7. Exercise all of the above

# Inferred Types

1. Create a class which uses let and var to store constant and variable strings and integers.
2. Demonstrate inferred types by leaving off Int and String

# Base and Derived Classes

1. Create BaseClass with pokeUser and messageUser functions and printlines
2. Create DerivedClass from BaseClass which calls super.pokeUser on an overridden function and also has a printline
3. Exercise the overridden and messageUser from the derived class

# For Loop

1. Create a loop for 0-9 and display index with \(i)
2. Create a collection of rain, snow, sleet.
3. Loop through with a function called forArrayLoop and println collection value
4. Exercise these with an allocation object

# Dictionary

1. Create collection type dictionary with state:capitalcity.
2. Create a function forDictionaryLoop with a let to some value with direction lookup
3. Create a function to loop through capitals and display state name and captials with \(caps.0) and 1
4. Exercise these with an allocation object

# Basic Swift App With Storyboard

1. Create project BasicSwiftObjcExample
2. Add Label and Button to Storyboard
3. Create a simple IBAction that changes the Label
4. Verify operation in Simulator
